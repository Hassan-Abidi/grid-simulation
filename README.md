## üíª Usage

### Running the Simulation

Execute the main simulation script:

```bash
python3 simulate_grid.py
```

### Output Files

The simulation generates two key outputs:

1. **`simulation_results.png`** - Comprehensive visualization of the 24-hour simulation
2. **`simulation_results.csv`** - Detailed hourly data for further analysis

### Customizing Profiles

To modify load or generation profiles, edit the CSV files in the `profiles/` directory:

- `base_load.csv` - Hourly load demand (kW)
- `pv_generation.csv` - Hourly PV generation (kW)
- `battery_specs.csv` - Battery system parameters

## üìà Results

### Performance Metrics

The simulation demonstrates significant benefits from intelligent battery control:

| Metric | Baseline (No Battery) | With Battery Control | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Peak Power Demand** | 8.50 kW | 6.00 kW | **‚Üì 29.4%** |
| **Congestion Proxy** | 359.00 | 281.62 | **‚Üì 21.6%** |

### Visualization

![Simulation Results](simulation_results.png)

The visualization shows three key aspects:

1. **Top Panel:** Base load, PV generation, and resulting net load profiles
2. **Middle Panel:** Battery charging/discharging behavior throughout the day
3. **Bottom Panel:** Final grid power demand and battery state of charge

### Key Insights

- **Morning Charging:** Battery charges during low-load periods (midnight to 6 AM) when grid capacity is available
- **Peak Shaving:** Battery discharges during evening peak (6-9 PM) to reduce maximum grid demand
- **PV Coordination:** Battery absorbs excess solar generation during midday, preventing reverse power flow
- **Congestion Relief:** Smoother power flows reduce stress on distribution infrastructure

## üî¨ Technical Details

### System Architecture

The simulation follows a modular architecture:

```
simulate_grid.py          # Main simulation engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ load_profiles()       # CSV data ingestion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_net_load()  # Load-generation balance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ initialize_battery()  # BESS initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ battery_control()     # Peak-shaving algorithm
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plot_results()        # Visualization generation
```

### Battery Control Algorithm

The control strategy implements a **threshold-based peak shaving** approach:

- **Discharge Mode:** When net load exceeds 6.0 kW, battery discharges to reduce grid demand
- **Charge Mode:** When net load falls below 2.0 kW, battery charges to store energy
- **Constraints:** All operations respect battery power limits and SOC boundaries

### Congestion Proxy Metric

The congestion proxy is calculated as:

```
Congestion = Œ£(P_grid[t]¬≤) for t = 0 to 23
```

This metric penalizes high power flows quadratically, making it sensitive to peak demands that stress grid infrastructure.
